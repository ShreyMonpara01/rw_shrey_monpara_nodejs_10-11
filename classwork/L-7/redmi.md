In Node.js applications, particularly when using the Express.js framework, req.query.id is used to access the value of a query parameter named "id" from the URL.
Explanation:
req:
This is the request object, provided by Express, which contains information about the incoming HTTP request.
.query:
This property of the req object is an object itself, containing all the URL query parameters as key-value pairs. Query parameters are the part of the URL after the question mark (?), e.g., ?id=123&name=John.
.id:
This accesses the specific value associated with the "id" key within the req.query object.
Example:
If a user makes a request to the URL http://localhost:3000/users?id=123, you can access the value "123" using req.query.id within your Express route handler:
JavaScript

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.query.id;
  console.log('User ID:', userId); // Output: User ID: 123
  res.send(`You requested user with ID: ${userId}`);
});
Key Distinction from req.params:
It is important to differentiate req.query from req.params. While both are used to extract values from the URL, they serve different purposes:
req.query:
Used for extracting query parameters, which are typically used for filtering, sorting, or providing optional data. They appear after a ? in the URL.
req.params:
Used for extracting route parameters, which are part of the defined route path and represent specific resources. They are defined with a colon (:) in the route, e.g., /users/:id.
Example of req.params:
JavaScript

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id; // Accesses the 'id' from the route path
  console.log('User ID from params:', userId);
  res.send(`You requested user with ID: ${userId}`);
});
In this case, a request to http://localhost:3000/users/456 would result in userId being "456".
